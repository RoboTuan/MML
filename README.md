# MML
Repository for the course "Mathematics in Machine Learning" at Politecnico di Torino.  
In this project I had to analize the [Dry Beans](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset) dataset with classic machine-learning methods. After a basic exploratory data analysis, I performed dimensionality reduction and applied resampling methods to balance the class distribution. Finally, I tried several classification algorithms with cross-validation combined with different data preprocessing and compared the results.  
In the [Jupiter Notebook](https://github.com/RoboTuan/MML/blob/main/dry_beans.ipynb) there is a theoretical explanation next to every used method.
